The _about box_ displays the software version and the information about the tools used in background.

![](img/about.png)

The status of each tool is indicated:

- ![](icons/bullet/bullet_green.png): The tool is well detected.
- ![](icons/bullet/bullet_yellow.png): The tool cannot be found but it's not necessary. Expect some features not to work properly even if the software is still usable.
- ![](icons/bullet/bullet_red.png): The tool cannot be found but it's necessary. The software is not usable. This happens when the tool cannot be located using the PATH variable.
